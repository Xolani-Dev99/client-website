      <h2>Where Little Explorers Grow Through Joyful Learning</h2>
      <p>
        We believe that childhood is a magical time — a season for laughter, curiosity, and incredible growth.
        That’s why at Romphe – The Children's Hut, we’ve created a warm, safe, and nurturing environment where children
        from 3 months to 5 years can discover the world at their own pace — with joy, creativity, and confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        From their first giggle to their first group play, every step of their journey is celebrated and supported by our passionate and experienced team.

      <h2>Qualified & Caring Teachers</h2>
      <p>
        Our educators are not just highly trained — they’re compassionate, attentive, and full of energy. They understand that each child is unique and tailor learning experiences accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        We follow a developmentally-appropriate educational programme that promotes early literacy, numeracy, emotional intelligence, and social skills — laying a strong foundation for school and life success.
      </p>

      <h2>Top-Notch Safety & Peace of Mind</h2>
      <p>
        Your child’s well-being is our top priority. At Romphe, we go the extra mile to ensure a secure and calm setting for learning and play:
      </p>

        <li>✅ On-site security guard at all times</li>
        <li>✅ 7 CCTV cameras throughout the premises</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can drop your child off with full confidence — knowing they are in safe, responsible, and caring hands.

      <h2>We Celebrate Uniqueness</h2>
      <p>
        No two children are the same — and that’s exactly how we like it. We honour every child’s personality, culture, learning style, and pace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to help children grow into confident, resilient, and joyful individuals — ready not just for school, but for life.
